# InfoStructureVR
A software project, six students, including me, made within a year. It is about loading in BIM data from buildings and to visualize them, so one can explore it in Virtual Reality. This repository includes an example of a building, which was imported through data smith inside UE4. The meta data provided inside the application is extracted from the BIM data and converted to a .csv-file. This csv-file is imported to UE4 and the data is asigned to the right object at runtime.
